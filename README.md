# EDA-SHARVA-SHIKSHA-ABHIYAN
The EDA project in Sharva Shiksha Abhiyan financial data involves analyzing historical budget allocation and expenditure data to identify patterns and trends. Using this analysis, a predictive model is developed to estimate the budget allocation for the next year.

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) is a flagship program of the Indian government aimed at
providing free and compulsory education to all children in the age group of 6 to 14 years.
The program was launched in 2001 and is implemented in partnership with state
governments, local communities, and other stakeholders. In our project we work using
various features available in the dataset to us, and analyse and predict results. EDA can be
used to analyse learning outcomes; this can help in identifying factors that affect learning
outcomes and designing interventions to improve learning outcomes.

There 5 steps in Exploratory Data Analysis which need to be followed, which are

1. Data Collection: This involves acquiring relevant data sets from various sources such
as databases, files, surveys, or web scraping.

2. Data Understanding: It is a crucial step in EDA. The goal of data understanding is to
gain insights into the structure, content, and quality of the data.

3. Data Cleaning: This step involves checking the quality of the collected data and
identifying any issues that may affect the analysis. The process may include removing
duplicates, filling in missing values, and correcting data format errors.

4. Data Visualization and Analysis: In this step, we use various statistical and
visualization techniques to explore the data and identify patterns and trends. This
includes examining the distribution of data, checking for outliers, and identifying
correlations between variables.

5. Data Prediction: After exploring the data, we can build and train various models to
predict or classify the target variable. This step involves selecting appropriate
algorithms and evaluating their performance on the data.
